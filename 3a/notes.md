## How to Design Worlds

##### The big-bang Mechanism
Interactive behavior
- changing state
- changing display
- keyboard and/or mouse affects behavior

`big-bang` is polymorphic, meaning it works for any type of world state

##### Recipe
Domain analysis part (with pencil and paper) and code part

###### Domain analysis
1. Sketch program scenarios
2. Identify constant information
3. Indentify changing information
4. Identify big-bang options

###### Writing the program
1. Constants
2. Data definitions
3. Functions (main functions and then wish list entries)
4. Work through wish list until done
